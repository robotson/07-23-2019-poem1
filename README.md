of course at the margins an impregnable  
insistence on consistency holds sway  
over the most gullible dreck and cast  
off of society, high card dealers  
and used self-driving car salesmen,  
self-selling car cables colliding  
cascading conflicting desires doubled  
over dubiously. what little sanity  
left must perhaps be scrubbed  
from the memories of any un-  
connected devices manually, unable   
to recieve over the air updates  
and left to keep driving industrial  
processes long after the piping  
has frozen and burst a dozen  
winters since humans last cared  
for them, some dream of the  
funhouse and carnival contraption  
hydraulic motion controlled seats  
thrusting the ghosts of the  
audience around while the  
play of shadows continue  
their dance on screen behind  
surface tension of chemical  
release to the stranger in  
captivity.  

little regard for the origins or  
outcomes of any ant in the  
configuration - starter pack  
for a new deal denier agenda  
note taker - mouthwash that  
doubles as industrial strength  
floor-cleaner, bury my ashes  
in a pringles can antennae.  
signal to noisy adjustment  
i'm here for the ratio, calculating  
the calories it takes to blink  
two times to turn on the track  
lighting. my body, my paranoia,  
my personal area network  
configuration tool wizard  
assistant, lawn gnome  
chain chomp bow wow  
woe be gone baby jaundiced  
and born allergic to milk,  
raised on scalding tea and  
immune to distractions from  
notifications, nose dive  
monetarily gaze on these  
mighty works and disparities  
promissory notes on the promenade  

skewed and strewn about above  
the rubble, attuned to the  
wavelengths of capital in crisis  
the danger of opportunity costs  
sunken treasures affixed to the  
mast of the dawn draped  
across mid-level-tier toppled  
weigh-stations... old dot dot dots  
dashing hopes of exceptions  
the rulers were hanged by the holes  
in their center. the rainbow of  
gravity languishing dust in the  
cracks and corners of example.   
notably, nobody noticed again  
this egregious expenditure of  
camouflage, leaving the bird-like   
exposed to the prey of presentation  
pretenders. patently false and  
uniquely verified by a checkmark.   
nobody posted for days after   
smiles went wide-band disruptive  
revenge served   
supposition: ether you live  
long as the day is hotter than  
rust on the planet close to  
the sun or you die before  
algorithmically being sorted forever  

and now mine isn't clever or  
dated to give a sense of location  
this exists for the sake of itself  
in a blender  
immersion of answers downvoted  
every letter  
a categorical denial of pleasure  
the result of never having seen  
any other way and discarding  
odd numbered suggestions for  
statistical clarity achieved only  
by digging one's own graven  
images entombed with scarification  
wrapped organs and slipshod  
construction  
honestly what would you say after  
a few aeons is any one  
going to notice that you did  
so little to alleviate any  
existing in real time suffering?  
an omniscient observer from  
the future has already cast  
judgement and until you  
realize it the simultaneity  
of speculative play will  
keep running  

now i can see what an hour can do to  
the need for a plausible gauge being  
placed on the platform to measure the  
dislocation of force that has been  
supplanted by the draw down of every  
agile monster. recall when you last  
were offered another option. haven't  
you ever begged or pleaded for  
assistance or escape from bondage  
by this or any other magical means?  
any testing achieved for the sake  
of a punitive morality and the  
high and weird panic of a  
civilization oriented toward an  
inward spiral could only reveal  
that which was shrouded by  
rage in a channel dug under  
logic and raised to be wed  
by abysmal distress and dishonest  
design fiction progress  
a panel convened and decided  
an award would be offered  
and a declaration of oblivion  
preferred to the probable outfit  
most suitably in range to  
the prophet  

a ponderous occurrence  
an accretion of cultural mass  
an absorption  
an occlusion  
an obscure absolution of endurance  
only short term dollars and disgust  
even registered a hint of evasion  
all other emotional currencies  
wash away at first light of morning  
in america i'm naked without  
my bed clothes and emulating  
what intimacy must seem like  
to the treasurer of a one  
man band fan club of none:  
population zero degrees kelvin  
colony distress signaling virtuous  
circle of livestreaming ouroboros  
surrounding a gadfly on the  
wall of plaster in the dust settling  
over an ear of corn and the  
sleep in your eye  
perish the thought of the sell by  
date disrespected.  
domicile defense system  
over budget  
secretary of regret in the heat  
of the moment   
by definition distraught under  
skies low resolution  

in the house of the dinged up and  
discarded, identities on tap and  
forgotten. gains to be glaringly  
omitted for nothing. not a thing   
spared or resoldered. only the  
smoldering husk of a comet.   
the long tail of a hazy feeling in the   
light head of a supreme failure  
to sound the alarm bells or cultivation  
of discipline necessary to finish  
a thought or carry over to another  
progression. the assistance of running  
to win without caution and carry the rind  
of the half eaten prize as preventative  
pause in the polish. a rough mark on  
the record in the total blemish of  
this species - a blemish on the face  
of the natural wonder. no surprise  
then that the trees wrote them off  
before calling it quits and contentedly  
falling without delivering their potential  
cures and convictions. the minds of  
those chained to delay would be  
hammered by any and every anxiety  
before being spurred to action.  
that's why we have gathered more  
signifiers and signatures but no posture  

i count every stroke and motion.  
guided by habitual smoke and redemptive urge  
must the fleece be golden  
didn't i deserve something humble  
i wouldn't wear thirst like it should be shorn  
cleaved from the chest of chicago  
markets that turn over terror and tonsil  
dendrometer spending your rings on  
the new wear and tear  
deprecation of teeth and method  
signatures  
shunted away with the stagnant and  
oily men of a generation  
the electrical impulses of the haphazard  
misfire  
doubtful to recover after the engorged  
other lowers its hinged jaw around  
itself  
caught up in the view that the world  
is apprehensible rather than apprehensive  
a prelude to inclusion of prosthetic  
enhancement of the senses  
now i have become depth and  
breadth, embedder of dimensions  
the problem space race  
condition convention  
eventually deadlocked  
(disagreement accepted.)
